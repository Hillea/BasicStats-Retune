-   “Shark attacks kill more people each year than lightning strikes.”

    -   False

# Why Statistics?

## Why is it important that YOU know statistics?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   You're doing a *PhD*!

-   We live in an increasingly data-centric world

-   Facts & data literacy matter more than ever!

    -   You should be able to call bullshit (<https://www.callingbullshit.org/>)
:::

::: notes
-   You're doing a *PhD*!

    -   Research = Reading & understanding papers (esp. the analyses)
    -   Designing your own experiments, analyze data, interpret results

-   We live in an increasingly data-centric world

    -   Knowing how to wrangle and analyze data is a valuable skill

-   Facts & data literacy matter more than ever!

    -   Fake News, "Lying with stats", Reproducibility Crisis

    -   Being able to call bullshit (<https://www.callingbullshit.org/>)

-   "I only believe in statistics that I doctored myself" ― Winston S. Churchill

    -   However: "It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them" ― Frederick Mosteller

## What can Statistics Do For Us?

-   **Describe** patterns by summarizing/breaking down data ("descriptive statistics")

-   **Decide** whether one thing is better than another, given the uncertainty ("inferential statistics")

-   **Predict** how other people would "behave" (generalize to new observations)

::: notes
describe: not useful to look at every single data point/person, but we need s.th. like tendencies/trends...
:::

## What are Data?

-   What do you think are data?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   qualitative vs. quantitative

    -   qualitative?

        -   open questions, descriptions... can potentially be coded into categories

    -   quantitative?

        -   numeric, can be averaged etc.
:::

::: notes
Chat → after showing slide! Come up with examples for "Data"

Collect: Do you have ideas? What are data you encounter in your lives/work etc? What are differences between these data?
:::

## What are Data? (2)

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Data types

    -   character/string: text (qualitative)

    -   factors/categories

    -   types of numbers (quantitative)

        -   binary: 0 or 1, TRUE or FALSE (logical)

        -   integers: whole numbers

        -   real numbers: decimals/fractions

-   discrete vs. continuous

    -   discrete: finite set of particular values (0 or 1, scale from 1 to 10)

    -   continuous: real numbers that fall into particular range (e.g., brain activity, visual analoge scale)

-   What data type is *eye color*?
:::

::: notes
eye color can be categorical (e.g., "brown", "blue", "green") or numerical (wave length in nm)
:::

## What is a Data Set?

-   a collection of data

-   usually organized into rows and columns (like an excel spreadsheet)

    -   rows: participants/animals/cells...

    -   columns: **variables**!

        -   each variable contains one type of measurement

    -   table cells = unique observations of variables per participant etc.

![NHANES dataset](images/Dataset.jpg)

::: notes
possibly go through columns and ask for data types?
:::

## What Makes a Good Measurement?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
<!-- -   Discuss! -->

-   What is being measured?

    -   constructs vs. proxies: need to be well-defined! (Difficult)

    -   measurement error

        -   random: e.g., variation in reaction times of same participant across trials

        -   systematic: e.g., miscalibrated eye-tracking device

-   Do we have a "gold standard" to compare the measurement to?
:::

::: notes
Break-Out session: Brainstorm what makes a good vs. bad measurement!

Group work/brainstorm:

-   What are problems?

-   Which kind of errors/when is data NOT good

-   how can we minimize error?
:::

## Reliability & Validity

Data that we collected should be both:

-   **reliable**: stable and consistent over time

-   **valid**: measuring the construct we're interested in

![Reliability & Validity](images/ReliabilityValidity-1.png){width="400"}

## Summarizing Data

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Throwing away (some of the) information!

    -   extract the quintessence of the data (important for forming *models*)

    -   make predictions

-   Counts, frequencies, percentages, averages
:::

# End of 1st part {.scrollable}

Learning objectives:

-   Why is statistics important?

-   What are data?

-   What is reliability and validity?
